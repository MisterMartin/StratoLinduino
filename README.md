# StratoLinduino
Hardware support files cherry-picked from ADI Linduino

These files provide Arduino device support for Analog
Devices Inc. (ADI) chips that are used in the LASP systems.

This repository can be referenced as a library
in PlatformIO *lib_deps*.

The initial ones commited to this repo were provided
in several .zip files, extracted from Lars' ArduinoIDE
development environment. Some sleuthing revealed that 
they came from scattered directories in the 
[ADI Linduino repository](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/Linduino.git).

These files are the versions that were provided by
Lars in June-2024. It is not known what dates/commits 
they came from in the ADI repository. 

TODO: Compare these files with the current files in the
ADI repository.

TODO: Create a library specification, and see if the
ArduinoIDE can install from GitHub.
